<h1> Education</h1>
<p> S. Soorya, 2nd May 2022</p>
<p>education, discipline that is concerned with methods of teaching and learning in schools or school-like 
environments as opposed to various nonformal and informal means of socialization 
(e.g., rural development projects and education through parent-child relationships).
<br />
Education can be thought of as the transmission of the values and accumulated knowledge of a society. In this 
sense, it is equivalent to what social scientists term socialization or enculturation. Children—whether conceived 
among New Guinea tribespeople, the Renaissance Florentines, or the middle classes of Manhattan—are born 
without culture. Education is designed to guide them in learning a culture, molding their behaviour in the ways
 of adulthood, and directing them toward their eventual role in society. In the most primitive cultures, there is
 often little formal learning—little of what one would ordinarily call school or classes or teachers. Instead, the 
entire environment and all activities are frequently viewed as school and classes, and many or all adults act as
 teachers. As societies grow more complex, however, the quantity of knowledge to be passed on from one
 generation to the next becomes more than any one person can know, and, hence, there must evolve more 
selective and efficient means of cultural transmission. The outcome is formal education—the school and the 
specialist called the teacher.
<br />
As society becomes ever more complex and schools become ever more institutionalized, educational experience 
becomes less directly related to daily life, less a matter of showing and learning in the context of the workaday 
world, and more abstracted from practice, more a matter of distilling, telling, and learning things out of context. 
This concentration of learning in a formal atmosphere allows children to learn far more of their culture than 
they are able to do by merely observing and imitating. As society gradually attaches more and more importance
 to education, it also tries to formulate the overall objectives, content, organization, and strategies of education.
 Literature becomes laden with advice on the rearing of the younger generation. In short, there develop 
philosophies and theories of education.
This article discusses the history of education, tracing the evolution of the formal teaching of knowledge and 
skills from prehistoric and ancient times to the present, and considering the various philosophies that have 
inspired the resulting systems. Other aspects of education are treated in a number of articles. For a treatment 
of education as a discipline, including educational organization, teaching methods, and the functions and 
training of teachers, see teaching; pedagogy; and teacher education. For a description of education in various 
specialized fields, see historiography; legal education; medical education; science, history of. For an analysis of 
educational philosophy, see education, philosophy of. For an examination of some of the more important aids in
 education and the dissemination of knowledge, see dictionary; encyclopaedia; library; museum; printing; 
publishing, history of. Some restrictions on educational freedom are discussed in censorship. For an analysis 
of pupil attributes, see intelligence, human; learning theory; psychological testing.
